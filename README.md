# r/region

**What?**<br>r/region is a web game where you can place 1 pixel of 16 colours every minute.
<br><br>
**Why?**<br>I wanted to recreate r/place (the 2017 April fools social experiment on Reddit) more faithfully to the original than other replicas.
<br><br>
**How?**<br>This project is open-source and the code can be viewed here.
<br><br>
**Who?**<br>This project was made by one of the few people called Barnaby and all copyright goes to me.<br>(Â© Barnaby#3108 2019)
